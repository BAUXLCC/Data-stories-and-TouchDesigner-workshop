##BlenderGIS with TouchDesigner and API Get

**(Blender)[https://www.blender.org/download/]**

**(BlenderGIS)[https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/releases/tag/2210]** - You only need to download the zip file from this link.

**(TDScripts)[https://www.patreon.com/posts/td-scripts-1-4-1-98699030]** - We probably won't get around to using this but consider it an added extra. Great little tool by Factory settings for quickly adding in static objects from Blender to TD. Download both the .py and .tox files(the .py you install in blender as you would any addon and the .tox you have open in TD at the same time)
